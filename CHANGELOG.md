# Changelog

Notable changes per release. Versions before `v0.1.0` are pre-releases: APIs, the schema and the evaluation dataset may change without a migration path.

## v0.1.0-alpha.1

The first tagged pre-release. It covers milestones M0, M1a and M1b: a walking skeleton with tenant isolation, an evaluation baseline, and hybrid retrieval with a published verdict.

### Authorization

- The tenant predicate is compiled once per request and embedded in every retrieval query. `AuthorizedChunkQuery` is the only reader of the chunk table, and an architecture test enforces that.
- Only tenant isolation is enforced. Clearance, department and project rules are milestone M2.
- Demo identities are JWTs signed with a published demo key. They are for local use only.

### Retrieval

- Three strategies: `sparse-only` (PostgreSQL full-text search), `dense-only` (exact pgvector search) and `hybrid-rrf` (reciprocal rank fusion with deduplication of overlapping chunks).
- Every response carries the hash of its retrieval plan. Scores and per-channel ranks are returned to tokens with the `debug` scope only.
- A hybrid query that cannot be embedded is answered from the sparse channel and marked `degraded`.

### Ingestion

- Asynchronous jobs: `202` and polling, a `SKIP LOCKED` worker with leases, bounded retry and resume after the last recorded document.
- Content-hash idempotency, an atomic switch between document versions, and version numbers that are never reused.
- Documents can be disabled and deleted; the change applies to the next query, and a background job removes unreachable versions.
- Markdown and plain-text chunking with sentence-level splitting and overlap inside a section.

### Evaluation

- 70 hand-checked cases over 21 fictional documents, with paraphrases, hard negatives and cross-tenant probes, split into `dev` and `test`.
- Evidence is labelled as a document version plus a quote, so chunking strategies are compared on the same labels.
- Bootstrap confidence intervals, paired comparisons, an offline BM25 reference row, and a security gate that fails CI on any unauthorized result.
- Published result ([report](./benchmarks/reports/m1b-hybrid/report.md), [analysis](./docs/evaluation/m1b-hybrid-analysis.md)): dense beats PostgreSQL full-text search on MRR@10, full-text search is measurably below BM25, and hybrid shows no detectable difference from dense.

### Not in this release

Label-based access rules, audit events, existence-leakage guarantees beyond retrieval, reranking, answer generation with citations, and tracing. See the [milestones](./docs/project/milestones.md).
